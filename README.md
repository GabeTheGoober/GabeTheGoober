**How many symphonies did Mozart write?**
  
For years this was categorized as a Mozart symphony, but later
scholarship determined that it was actually composed by Michael Haydn (No. 25),
and Mozart wrote only the slow introduction for it. The three final symphonies
(Nos. 39-41) were completed in about three months in 1788.
